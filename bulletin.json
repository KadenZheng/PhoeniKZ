		"description": "All UHS students and parents are invited to a FREE Drama preview of the Fresno State play called 4000 Miles this Thursday evening, Sept. 29 at 7:30pm at the Dennis and Cheryl Woods Theatre at Fresno State. The central character of 4,000 MILES is a troubled, but free-spirited 21 year-old man who has biked across America and suddenly arrives at his 91 year-old grandmothers apartment in New York. These two unlikely roommates struggle for much needed connection, an important theme after these years of Covid isolation. Serious theme with lots of laughs! 14 years and older is recommended"
