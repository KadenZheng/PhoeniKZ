This is an excellent opportunity for students in Musicianship IV, III, or freshmen and sophomores to glimpse the masterful work of Brahms (also, performed by one of UHS's very own previous founders: Dr. Brad Huff). Tickets are available at https://fresnocommunitychorus.org/tickets/ and there should be a discounted price for students. Contact fresnocommunitychorus@gmail.com."
